# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

* name: _Tiana Ton Nu_
* status: _complete_
* compilation instructions:
   * `gcc -o piku piku.s`
   * `./piku
* issues encountered: It took a few tries to figure out how to make the additional printf calls, but after taking a moment to remember how assembly programs were set up in CSC 255, I was able to get it working.
